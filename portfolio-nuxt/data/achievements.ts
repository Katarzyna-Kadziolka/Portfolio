        Description: "My team 'Śpiące Wydry' won first place in the SheepYourHack 2 hackathon. I was responsible for project management, presentation and business development. Our project was an app called Printy. It solves the problem of poor access to print outlets. Using the app, anyone can find a printer from an individual close to them and print something. The printer, on the other hand, can make money from lending his unused printer. The app also supports 3D printing and implies cooperation not only with individuals, but also with printers.",
